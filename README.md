📊 Customer Churn Analysis
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates end‑to‑end data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on telecom customer data using Python and SQL. The goal is to uncover churn patterns, revenue impact, and high‑risk customer segments to support business decision‑making.

🔹 Steps
- Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized categorical variables, and converted numeric fields.
- Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of tenure, monthly charges, and contract types.
- Bivariate Analysis
- Relationship between churn and features like payment methods, contract types, and monthly charges.
- Multivariate Analysis
- Correlation heatmaps and pairplots to identify combined effects of multiple variables.
- Conclusion & Findings
- Month‑to‑Month contracts and electronic check payments show highest churn.
- Senior citizens with fiber optic internet are at greater risk.
- Non‑churned customers contribute significantly higher revenue.

🔹 Tools & Technologies
- Python: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- SQL: Queries for churn rate, revenue impact, and KPI calculations
- Power BI / Excel: Dashboard creation for visualization and reporting

🔹 Key Insights
- Customers with Month‑to‑Month contracts and Electronic check payments churn more frequently.
- Senior citizens using Fiber optic internet are at higher churn risk.
- Retained customers generate higher lifetime revenue, highlighting the importance of retention strategies.

📌 Business Impact
This analysis helps identify high‑risk customer segments and supports targeted retention campaigns, ultimately improving customer loyalty and revenue stability.
